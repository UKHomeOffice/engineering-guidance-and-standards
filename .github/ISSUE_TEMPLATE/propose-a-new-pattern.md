Our engineering patterns are example solutions for addressing problems, meeting standards and living our engineering principles. They should make it easier for engineers to do their jobs. We don't have a standard way of writing patterns as we like to be a bit more flexible with their structure. Please provide us with some information on what you are proposing below

**What is the pattern you are suggesting?**
A concise description of the pattern, and when you expect it would be used

**What would be the benefit to the Home Office of following this pattern**
This could be the mitigation of risks, or the improvement of other aspects, for example quality or speed of delivery

**How do people implement this pattern**
Here you can point to frameworks, third party guidance or anything else that best describes the solution you are proposing

**Additional information**
Add any other information you think would be useful here

- [ ] I have looked through our existing patterns and think this is not covered elsewhere
- [ ] I have checked through the open issues on the repository and this pattern has not already been suggested
