All members of the team should consider the security of the application or 
service they are delivering. Everyone should understand how their own 
behaviours affect the security of the Home Office.

---

## Rationale

Integrating security thinking throughout the software delivery lifecycle 
shortens feedback loops and allows for more efficient redress when concerns 
are identified. Teams that are collectively conscious of security are more 
effective at implementing appropriate threat reduction measures.

An understanding of the security aspects of team and personal behaviours - 
beyond core engineering activities - also deepens the Home Office defence 
against threat actors who are prepared to use social engineering attacks.

## Applications and Implications

- Use and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever necessary
- Put your security 'hat' on - think like an attacker to assess security
- Seek out  continuous professional development and attend relevant training on Security
- Practice sensible personal operational security to mitigate against phishing and social engineering attacks
