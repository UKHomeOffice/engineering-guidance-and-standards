Designing systems with security in mind is more effective, quicker and cheaper than trying to 'bolt it on' at the end of a development lifecycle. 

---

## Rationale

Shift consideration of security 'left' so that it informs work as early as possible, and so that security processes are baked into the ongoing support of the service.

---

## Applications and Implications

- Think about the security of your software supply chain before components become dependencies
- Re-use shared patterns, processes and components rather than building your own, and consider their maintenance
- Engage with Home Office Cyber Security early
- Security controls should be on by default and require minimal configuration
