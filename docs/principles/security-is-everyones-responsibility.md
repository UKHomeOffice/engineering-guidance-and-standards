All members of the team, not just technical people, should collaborate to 
consider the security of the application or service they are delivering. 
Everyone should understand how their own behaviours affect the security of 
the Home Office.

---

## Rationale

Engaging with wider security communities, and integrating security thinking 
throughout the software delivery lifecycle, shortens feedback loops in teams. 
This allows for more efficient redress when concerns are identified. Teams 
that and are collectively conscious of security, and embed security people 
when necessary, are more effective at implementing appropriate threat 
reduction measures.

An understanding of the security aspects of team and personal behaviours - 
beyond core engineering activities - deepens the Home Office defence 
against the wide range of attacks threat actors are prepared to use.

## Applications and Implications

- Use and implement Multi-Factor AuthenticationÂ (MFA) wherever proportionate
- Put your security 'hat' on - think like an attacker to assess security
- Seek out continuous professional development and attend relevant training on security
- Keep the whole team involved in discussions on security - all disciplines can have a positive impact on how security is embedded in your services
- Practice sensible personal operational security to mitigate against attacks on Home Office personnel, for example social engineering attacks
- Collaborate with Home Office cyber security teams, and other delivery teams, to understand available security capabilities and share things that might be reused
