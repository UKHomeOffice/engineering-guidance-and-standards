Engineers have needs. We will continuously improve the ways that we meet those needs, and support our engineers so that they have a good experience.

## Rationale

Engineers complete work more quickly, and at higher quality, when the tools, environments and teams they work with provide the right capabilities and support. When they don't have those things work moves more slowly, technical debt is accrued and security can be compromised. It is important to remember that engineers are users too, we already have proven patterns for the best ways to meet user needs and they should be followed.

To improve engineer experience we will meet engineering needs in the same way as we would with any other user need, centering engineers' feedback and experience when testing solutions that have been designed for them. This will provide us with a measurable and evidenced approach to factors that contribute to productivity and efficiency.

## Applications and Implications

- Approach cloud platform engineering in a way that delivers platforms as products that are developed according to tenants needs
- Do user research with engineers to understand how they use tools and services, and where we can improve
- Look at the whole experience for engineers, understand how teams and organisation impact the work that they do, alongside the tools and services they consume
- Build up a useful body of knowledge for engineers to follow and refer to, making their jobs easier by promoting common patterns and golden paths to achieve their objectives
