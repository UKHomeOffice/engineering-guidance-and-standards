The concept of "shift left" means to move tasks as early in the software development lifecycle as possible. 

The phrase "shift left" is derived from the notion of moving tasks to the left on a Scrum or Kanban board.

Reduce risk, improve quality, security and reliability by moving tasks "to the left" as early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) as possible.
