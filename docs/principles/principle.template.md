Please see https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/markdown/#line-breaks for notes on usage of line breaks.

# Notes on using links

Internal links need to follow this format:
[link text to internal page]({{ '/standards/writing-a-standard/' | url }})
Note the use of the `url` filter. This ensures the link is appended to the base URL of the webpage correctly.

External links follow standard markdown formatting:
[link text to external page](https://example.com)
