Proportionate security enables both usable and secure services. Understand 
the value of the asset you are engineering, and your threat context, and 
implement security to mitigate specific risks or threats. Work with 
security teams to make decisions so that controls are being implemented for 
appropriate reasons.

## Rationale

At the Home Office we build and operate systems in our own threat landscape, 
with particular vectors to consider, including motivated, well-funded and 
well-organised threat actors. These vectors require effective defences. 
Security features require effort to implement and maintain. Overly restrictive 
security controls incur unnecessary cost and can drive unintended andÂ unwanted 
behaviour. 

Security controls that are designed to mitigate understood risks are easier 
to test and measure for their effectiveness. It is important to implement 
security features that deliver valuable counters to threats, are balanced 
with user needs and facilitate the ongoing operation and iteration of our 
services.

## Applications and Implications

- Use threat modelling techniques to understand the landscape and actors. This will help to identify threats and risks against your architecture holistically, including shared capabilities or services
- Test security features with users to minimise potential negative impacts on user experience
- Consider the cost vs benefit of proposed controls
- Implement and contribute to the Home Office engineering security standards by collaborating with security teams
