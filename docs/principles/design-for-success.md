Systems and applications should be designed so that they can be efficiently developed and deliver their intended value. You should have success criteria to measure your designs against.

---

## Rationale

A clear understanding and focus on meeting user and business needs is vital for delivering value for money when designing software solutions. Meeting non-functional requirements at the right time (often earlier) reduces the effort and cost of building secure and performant applications.

Ensuring that there are pragmatic success criteria for what is to be built, how and when, makes assurance of design easier, allows for better management of technical debt and carries through to more maintainable solutions

## Applications and Implications

- Engage with and understand the needs of your stakeholders. Get their feedback regularly to be assured that you are delivering value
- Actively manage technical debt and design your implementation so the solution is the right size at the right time
- Build or leverage reusable components and patterns where appropriate
- Design for the minimal team - consider existing Home Office engineering capabilities when making technology choices so that iteration and support are achievable without unnecessary overhead
- Use Wardley maps to inform designs - this will allow you to more confidently identify where you should innovate and where you can consume existing commodity components
- Keep it simple, but think about extensibility - will your design allow for delivery of potential future needs? Can you use a simpler framework that will allow you to deliver more quickly?
