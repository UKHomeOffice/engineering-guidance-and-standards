A working product is more important than documentation, but good documentation improves maintainability, onboarding, and compliance. This pattern defines a recommended approach for creating and managing documentation across Home Office engineering projects.

## Why do this?

- **Findability matters**: Documentation should be easy to locate, searchable, and filterable.
- **Single source of truth**: Avoid duplication; link rather than copy.
- **Clarity and accessibility**: Use plain language and comply with WCAG standards.
- **Security awareness**: Include guidance on how to raise a security issue.
- **Human review**: Documentation should be checked by someone who understands the problem, especially if generated by AI.
- **Value-driven**: Documentation must provide real value, not just tick a box.

## How to do this

### Recommended Documentation

Every repository should include:

- **README.md**: Project and repository overview, purpose, and links to further documentation
- **Architecture**:
  - High-level diagrams (system context, dependencies)
  - Database and class diagrams (only if useful and maintained)
- **Project structure**: Document how to navigate the source code, especially where folder structure is significant to the working of the code
- **Security policy**: How vulnerabilities are handled and compliance references
- **Coding conventions**: Language-specific standards and commenting guidelines for your project
- **Change log & versioning**:
  - All production releases documented
  - Release notes and version history aligned with supported versions


### Recommended Practices

- **Docs as Code**: Use tools like [Gov.UK eleventy plugin](https://govuk-eleventy-plugin.x-govuk.org/) for automation where possible. You can find more guidance in the [docs-as-code pattern]({{ '/patterns/docs-as-code/' | url }}).
- **Version Control**: Documentation should live alongside code in source control and follow the same versioning as your code. Using Confluence or SharePoint will also enable versioning, updates should be recorded in the platforms file history.```
- **Minimum repository standard**:
  - README
  - Architecture overview
  - Security policy
  - Changelog
  - Release notes
  - CONTRIBUTING
  - Code of conduct
- **Templates & Patterns**: Provide templates for minimum documentation and structure. For example the [SEGAS template for a standard](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/engineering-guidance-and-standards/blob/main/docs/standards/standard.template.md)
- **Present documentation where it is useful**: For example, document how to raise a issues and pull requests with issue and pull request templates.
- **Avoid Over-engineering**: Keep it simple; focus on usefulness.

## Things to consider

- **Autogenerated documentation**: Class diagrams and API docs can be helpful but often messy if not curated
- **AI-assisted documentation**:
  - AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) can help generate starting points for README files, function comments, or summaries
  - Avoid relying on AI for everything, unchecked AI-generated docs can be inaccurate, verbose, or add no real value
  - Always review and refine AI output to ensure clarity, correctness, and compliance
- **Legacy systems**: Have a strategy for improving or replacing disorganised documentation
- **Security implications**: Ensure automation or AI tools do not expose sensitive information

---

## Compliance & Standards

- Start with [Minimal documentation set for a product standard](/standards/minimal-documentation-set-for-a-product/), refine for your project.
- Ensure alignment with the Service Standard and evidence requirements.
- Accessibility and clarity are non-negotiable.
