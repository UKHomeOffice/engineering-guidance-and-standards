A working product is more important than documentation, but good documentation improves maintainability, onboarding, and compliance. This pattern defines a recommended approach for creating and managing documentation across Home Office engineering projects.

## Why do this?

- **Findability matters**: Documentation should be easy to locate, searchable, and filterable.
- **Single source of truth**: Avoid duplication; link rather than copy.
- **Clarity and accessibility**: Use plain language and comply with WCAG standards.
- **Security awareness**: Include guidance on how to raise a security issue.
- **Human review**: Documentation should be checked by someone who understands the problem, especially if generated by AI.
- **Value-driven**: Documentation must provide real value, not just tick a box.

## How to do this

### Recommended Documentation

Every repository should include:

- **README.md**: Project overview, purpose, and links to service standard evidence.
- **Architecture**:
  - High-level diagrams (system context, dependencies).
  - Database and class diagrams (only if useful and maintained).
- **Folder Structure**: Clear organisation for docs-as-code (e.g., GovUK Eleventy).
- **Security Policy**: How vulnerabilities are handled and compliance references.
- **Coding Conventions**: Language-specific standards and commenting guidelines for your project.
- **Change Log & Versioning**:
  - All production releases documented.
  - Release notes and version history aligned with supported versions.

---

### Recommended Practices

- **Docs as Code**: Use tools like GovUK Eleventy for automation where possible.
- **Version Control**: Documentation should live alongside code in GitHub and follow the same versioning as your code.
- **Minimum GitHub Repo Standard**:
  - README
  - Architecture overview
  - Security policy
  - Changelog
  - Release notes
- **Platform Alignment**:
  - Engineering: Confluence preferred.
  - Business: SharePoint.
- **Templates & Patterns**: Provide templates for minimum documentation and structure.
- **Avoid Over-engineering**: Keep it simple; focus on usefulness.

## Things to consider

- **Autogenerated documentation**: Class diagrams and API docs can be helpful but often messy if not curated.
- **AI-assisted documentation**:
  - AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) can help generate starting points for README files, function comments, or summaries.
  - **Avoid relying on AI for everything**: Unchecked AI-generated docs can be inaccurate, verbose, or add no real value.
  - Always review and refine AI output to ensure clarity, correctness, and compliance.
- **Legacy systems**: Have a strategy for improving or replacing disorganised documentation.
- **Security implications**: Ensure automation or AI tools do not expose sensitive information.

## Compliance & Standards

- Start with [Minimal documentation set for a product standard](/standards/minimal-documentation-set-for-a-product/), refine for your project.
- Ensure alignment with the Service Standard and evidence requirements.
- Accessibility and clarity are non-negotiable.
