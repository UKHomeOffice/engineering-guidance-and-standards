Code reviews are a vital part of the software lifecycle. They can keep code quality to a high standard as well as share knowledge between team members.

## Solution

### Code reviews should be part of your teams workflow

Time should be allocated as part of your sprint to review code, as it's important to keep high coding standards.

### Code reviews should be constructive and friendly

When reviewing code, you should focus on the code, not the author. Remember that every developer has different ideas and solutions to problems. Using reasons to explain why something needs changing is much more valuable than expressing your feelings.

### Point out the good things as well as bad

Positive feedback can help build a positive culture within your team, and it's always nice to hear positive feedback.

### Have a pull request template

A [pull request template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) can help you create a checklist of what to do before/while creating a pull request, it can also be useful for the person reviewing the code too.

### Support your code reviews with automation

Automate as much as possible to help relieve the code review burden, things like testing and linters can be automated. Tools like ESLint and Prettier can help with this.

## Considerations

### Some of the things that should be checked for

This is not an exaustive list, just some recommendations, but your team should have their own standards, a pull request template can help with this too by creating a checklist of what to look for.

Does it work as intended?
: Does the code look like it would work like the author intended? Does it work as users would expect?

Is it tested?
: Are the tests well designed? Is there enough coverage? Are the tests automated? Does it pass automated testing? Does it pass linting checks?

Is it easy to read?
: Can you clearly understand what the code is doing? Are variables, functions etc. names descriptive? Is the code too complex? Are comments useful and clear? Are the comments needed?

Is the software well designed?
: Is there good error handling? Does it fit with the rest of the code in the project? Have they thought about edge cases? Can you see any security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or other bugs?

Does the code protect against misuse?
: Does the code have any security vulnerabilities, e.g. does it allow code injection? Do error messages contain too much information? Is user input validated?

Do the changes consider existing code?
: Is there existing code doing something similar? Can a shared function be extended instead? Does it match the style and convetions of the team. Does it make good use of the application's framework?

Pay particular attention to this if the code may have generated by AI which is not aware of shared functions/services etc?

Is the code documented?
: Should there be more documentation around this code? Would you need more information before working on it?

Does it follow standards?
: Does it follow the team's standards? Does it follow [SEGAS standards](/standards/)? Does it follow [service manual standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)?

Do regular expessions make sense?
: Does a regex work as expected? Does it include all edge cases?
