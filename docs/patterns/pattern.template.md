# Notes on linking to headings within a page

Heading tags are automatically assigned an id, converting spaces to `kebab-case` and applying URL encoding. If you want to link to a specific heading, you can obtain the URL encoded link by running the site locally, inspecting the appropriate <h3> element in the browser's developer tools and copying the value from the 'id' attribute.
