The Home Office Engineering Guidance and Standards site is a body of knowledge for software engineers. It is comprised of principles, patterns and standards that define how we do engineering at the Home Office, and that direct how we want to do engineering in the future. This guidance is created and curated by the Home Office engineering community. The project as a whole is led by the Home Office DDaT Engineering Profession team.

## Why we are doing it

The Home Office has a large estate of teams and technology products. There is a wealth of experience and best practice that we can draw on, to standardise some of the things that we do and manage quality consistently. This will help us to deliver secure, performant technology that meets user needs, and deliver it quickly.

In 2021 we conducted a discovery across a wide range of our engineering teams, including suppliers and civil servants, and encompassing all of our delivery portfolios. We found that there were a number of key areas that we should prioritise for centralised guidance. Since then we have been running guilds and other working groups to identify the more specific needs of our engineers, and develop guidance to meet those needs.

This guidance was originally published on an internal content platform. We have since decided to open source it here for a number of reasons, the three main reasons being:

1. We work in government and should be as transparent as we can be about how we work. We are committed to following the service standard and the Home Office DDaT strategy by working in the open.

2. It makes it easier for people to find and use. Navigating around the different internal locations of documentation in the Home Office isn't always straightforward. We want our people and partners to be able to quickly discover the information they need to work.

3. It means that our peers and colleagues, across government and technology communities, can see how we work, and contribute to improvement. We are keen to adopt ways of working from open source communities, and become a better contributor to them too.

## How we manage the site

Proposed content for principles, standards and patterns go through a short process of collaborative creation, and require approval from Home Office engineering leadership to be merged into the site. This is managed via a process which will be familiar to users of GitHub - creating issues and branches for new content, and raising pull requests for review. We also have a small group of engineers committed to the ongoing maintenance and improvement of this site.

You can find out more about how to contribute in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/engineering-guidance-and-standards/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and you can [raise an issue directly onto the GitHub repository](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/engineering-guidance-and-standards/issues).

## Our roadmap

We have work on site and content improvements happening in parallel. The long term enhancements we are looking at are below:

- Grow the body of guidance and standards by continuing to engage our wide engineering community, and supporting them to create new content
- Build a self-assurance mechanism so that teams can easily assert compliance with the standards
- Continue development of the site so that it is an examplar of conformance to our growing collection of standards
