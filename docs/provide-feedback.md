We welcome feedback on all content in the site, or on any other areas that we can improve. There are two ways that you can provide feedback to us.

## Raise an issue on our GitHub repository

This is the preferred option. If you raise an issue on our repository you can easily track our response and progress when addressing it.

You will need a GitHub account in order to create an issue, which will involve agreeing to [GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Get in touch directly

If you do not want to raise an issue on GitHub then you can contact the members of our engineering community that maintain the site at [segas@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:segas@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk).
