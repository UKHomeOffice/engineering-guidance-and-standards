# Notes on linking to headings within a page

Heading tags are automatically assigned an id, converting spaces to `kebab-case` and applying URL encoding. If you want to link to a specific heading, you can obtain the URL encoded link by running the site locally, inspecting the appropriate <h3> element in the browser's developer tools and copying the value from the 'id' attribute.

# Notes on anchor links

Use HTML URL encoding as in the 'Notes on links' above, to ensure that links to headers with punctuation works as expected. For example:

[Product documentation MUST include build, release and deployment processes](#product-documentation-must-include-build%2C-release-and-deployment-processes)

-->

- [Requirement 1](#requirement-1)
- [Requirement 2](#requirement-2)
