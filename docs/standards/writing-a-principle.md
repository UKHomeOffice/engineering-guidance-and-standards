## Rationale

Principles will include each of the components as described below, so that 
intent and implications are clear.

### Name

State the essence of the principle and make it easy to remember. Specific 
technology platforms should not be mentioned in the name or statement of a 
principle. Avoid ambiguous words in the Name and in the Statement such as: 
"support", "open", "consider", and remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs 
(fluff).

### Statement

Succinctly and unambiguously communicate the fundamental principle. It is vital
that the principles statement is unambiguous. The reader should readily discern
the answer to: "How does this affect me?".

### Rationale

State why the principle is important and why it has been adopted. Highlight the
technical and business benefits of adhering to the principle. Do not 
oversimplify or overestimate the merit of the principle.

### Applications and Implications

Highlight ways to apply the principle - approaches, activities and tasks. 
Then elaborate on the value of that
If there are implications then you must clear state this.

You do not need to write not a complete set of things to do or enumerate on
all the implications. It is a list of helpful examples.

### Last Updated

Rather than providing versioning, show the date the principle was last updated.
