A Home Office engineering project should be documented to a minimum standard so that new engineers can be easily 
onboarded, and knowledge is not siloed within the team.

## Requirements
Engineers should own the following:
- A description of the product and what it is for
- Key stakeholders
- An architecture diagram showing how your components are connected
- Decision Log
- Incident management process
- Runbook
- Build, release, deploy process

### A description of the product and what it is for
The description should provide domain context to an engineer and link to product documentation.

### Architectural views
The architectural views may contain architecture diagrams, security models, entity-relationship models. The views should allow an engineer to understand how the components interact at a high level.

### Decision Log
A decision log should record key design decisions in context. A pattern should be selected to compliment the team ways of working, and may include for example [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/). 

### Incident management process
An incident management process should include points of contact, runbooks, and details of alerting and monitoring dashboards.

Points of contact should include technical points of contact within the team. Where possible, include multiple points of contact.

### Build, release, deploy process


There should be links to following produced by other professions where these exist:

- Key stakeholders
- User research findings
- Product roadmap
- Business analysis findings
- Governance and assurance documentation.
    - ITHC reports/documentation
    - Security audits
    - Service design package
