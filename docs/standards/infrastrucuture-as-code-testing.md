Infrastructure as Code (IaC) testing is a critical practice for ensuring the security, compliance, and functionality of infrastructure configurations before deployment. It encompasses a range of testing methodologies, including syntax validation, security scanning, compliance checks, and functional testing, applied to technologies like AWS Cloud Formation, IAM security, and Kubernetes manifests. Leveraging test-driven development (TDD) for IaC modules and automating tests within CI/CD pipelines ensures rapid feedback and continuous validation.

Maintaining a dedicated testing environment and continuously updating testing tools and policies are essential for staying ahead of evolving threats and best practices. This approach provides reliability, robust security, and consistency across all environments, minimising the risks associated with untested infrastructure, such as deployment chaos, security breaches, and costly operational failures. By proactively addressing issues, IaC testing enables a predictable and reliable infrastructure, minimising disruptions, and maximising efficiency.

## Requirements

- [You MUST do static code analysis](#You-MUST-do-static-code-analysis).
- [You MUST do component and integration tests of individual components](#You-MUST-do-component-and-integration-tests-of-individual-components).
- [You MUST do functional and regression testing](#You-MUST-do-functional-and-regression-testing).
- [You MUST do security and compliance checks](#You-MUST-do-security-and-compliance-checks).
- [You MUST do performance testing](#You-MUST-do-performance-testing).
- [You MUST do operational acceptance testing](#You-MUST-do-operational-acceptance-testing).

### You MUST do static code analysis

Static code analysis examines source code without executing it to identify potential defects, vulnerabilities, and coding standard violations. It automates the detection of issues early in the development lifecycle, improving code quality and security. Implement static code analysis tools for scanning IaC files for issues that may lead to security or compliance problems and misconfiguration issues. In addition, scans can check for compliance with common industry standards such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Foundations Benchmark.

### You MUST do component and integration tests of individual components 

Component tests the correctness of individual infrastructure modules e.g., modules in isolation. Integration testing validates that multiple components work together in a deployed environment and so prevents conflicts and misconfigurations when combining services.
 
### You MUST do functional and regression testing

Functional testing in IaC verifies that deployed infrastructure components perform their intended tasks correctly, validating interactions and dependencies between resources. Regression testing ensures that changes to IaC code do not introduce unintended side effects or break existing functionality, maintaining stability, and preventing configuration drift.

### You MUST do security and compliance checks

Security testing within IaC verifies that infrastructure configurations adhere to security best practices and prevent vulnerabilities such as unauthorised access. Compliance checks ensure configurations meet regulatory and organisational standards, guaranteeing adherence to policies and avoiding potential penalties.

### You MUST do performance testing

Performance testing of IaC components rigorously evaluates the resource utilisation, latency, and throughput of individual infrastructure modules under simulated load conditions. It focuses on isolating and measuring the efficiency of specific configurations, like network settings or compute resources, to ensure they meet defined performance benchmarks and handle anticipated traffic.

### You MUST do operational acceptance testing

Focus on Validating Reliability and Availability without unexpected failures (Chaos Engineering), Regulatory compliance (GDPR), Observability mechanisms (AWS CLoudWatch, Prometheus & Grafana, Data Dog) work as expected, Backup & Disaster Recovery (RDS snapshots) strategies in case of failures to confirm that the infrastructure is ready for long-term operations.
