Test parallelisation is an essential strategy for optimising automated testing, particularly as test suites expand and threaten to impede release velocity. 

By dividing the test suite into multiple independent runs executed concurrently across separate processes, teams can dramatically reduce overall execution time, significantly accelerating the feedback loop for developers. This technique is critical for preventing large test suites from becoming bottlenecks within the CI/CD pipeline, thereby enabling faster iterations and more frequent releases.

To effectively implement parallelisation and maximize its benefits, adherence to key principles is crucial:

### You MUST split tests based on criticality, execution time, complexity, and dependencies

Strategic test parallelisation in software engineering is based around dividing test suites by criticality, execution time, complexity, and dependencies. Prioritising critical tests ensures core functionality stability, while separating long and short tests optimises feedback loops. Isolating complex tests prevents delays, and managing dependencies ensures accurate parallel execution. These practices lead to faster feedback, efficient resource use, and improved test reliability, enhancing software quality and release speed.

### You MUST Isolate test data for each parallel test run

Isolating test data for each parallel test run is a fundamental principle for effective test parallelisation. By providing each test with its own unique data set, you eliminate data dependencies and race conditions, ensuring tests run independently and reliably. This isolation prevents data contamination, where one test's actions unintentionally affect another, leading to false positives or negatives. Consequently, parallel execution becomes predictable and consistent, maximising the speed and accuracy of the test suite, and contributing to faster, more reliable software releases.

### You MUST adopt parallelisation, when running same test suite across multiple environments (cross environments)

Parallelising test execution across multiple environments significantly accelerates the validation of software compatibility and consistency. By running the same test suite concurrently on different operating systems, browsers, or platform configurations, teams can quickly identify environment-specific issues. This approach significantly reduces the time needed to ensure software performs reliably across diverse setups, enabling faster feedback on compatibility and minimising environment-related defects in production. Ultimately, cross-environment parallelisation enhances confidence in the software's robustness and ensures a consistent user experience regardless of the platform.

### You MUST implement parallelisation to reduce waiting time for CI/CD pipeline

Parallelisation within CI/CD pipelines significantly reduces waiting times by executing tests concurrently, instead of sequentially. This principle accelerates the feedback loop, allowing developers to identify and fix issues faster. By running tests in parallel, pipelines can complete in a significantly reduced time, enabling quicker deployments and more frequent releases. This efficiency minimises delays, optimises resource utilisation improving productivity and accelerating deployment schedules.

### You MUST ensure that acceptance tests should finish as quickly as the code compiles and builds

The goal of test parallelisation is to reduce the overall time it takes for your tests to run in the pipeline. A test pack, especially as it scales, can hold numerous long-running tests or intricate scenarios. If the pipeline's duration is directly influenced by this, the benefits of parallelisation are negated, leading to prolonged wait times and reduced productivity. Ensure that the time it takes for your acceptance tests to run in the pipeline is comparable to the time it takes for the code to be compiled and built in the pipeline.

### You MUST adopt parallelisation when frequent deployments are required

When deployment frequency is high, parallelisation becomes essential to maintain rapid release cycles. By executing tests concurrently, parallelisation ensures that each deployment is quickly validated. This approach enables faster feedback loops enable rapid issue resolution, maintaining a smooth and efficient deployment process.
