Automated accessibility testing, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, shifts accessibility validation left, resulting in earlier detection and resolution of common issues. By automating a significant portion of accessibility checks (it is key to acknowledge that automated testing will only identify between 30 and 40% of accessibility issues), teams can proactively address potential barriers, ensuring web applications meet accessibility standards from the outset. This early intervention reduces the burden of manual testing, allowing human experts to focus on complex user-centric issues and ultimately delivering a more inclusive and accessible user experience.

- [You MUST automate scanning with established tools](#You-MUST-automate-scanning-with-established-tools).
- [You MUST integrate your tools into the CI/CD pipeline](#You-MUST-integrate-your-tools-into-the-CI/CD-pipeline).

- [You MUST apply regular updates](#You-MUST-apply-regular-updates).

### You MUST explore use of static checks

Static code checks, through linters, enforce coding standards and detect defects early, improving code quality and automating reviews, while customisation and integration into workflows ensure consistent, actionable feedback. This proactive approach prevents non-compliant code deployment, streamlines development, and significantly enhances software maintainability and reliability.

### You MUST automate scanning with established tools

Implementing automated scanning with industry-standard tools like Axe, Lighthouse, or WAVE involves integrating these tools into the development workflow to perform systematic checks for common accessibility violations across all web pages and components. This automated process provides a rapid baseline assessment, identifying obvious accessibility issues such as missing alt text, insufficient colour contrast, and incorrect semantic mark-up, early in the development lifecycle. By quickly surfacing these issues, teams can significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual accessibility testing, allowing for faster iterations and quicker resolution of critical problems. 


### You MUST integrate your tools into the CI/CD pipeline

Incorporating automated accessibility tests into the CI/CD pipeline ensures continuous validation with every code change, transforming accessibility testing from a post-development task to an integral part of the development process. This integration triggers automated scans using tools like Axe or Lighthouse whenever new code is committed, providing immediate feedback on potential accessibility violations. By catching regressions and new issues early, developers can address them promptly, preventing accessibility defects from propagating through the pipeline and reaching production.

### You MUST configure your tools for relevant accessibility standards

Configuring automated accessibility testing tools adhere to specific accessibility standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) levels A, AA, or AAA, involves setting parameters within the tools to enforce precise rules and criteria relevant to those standards. This customisation ensures that automated checks are not generic, but rather aligned with the specific regulatory and best-practice requirements that the web application must meet. Detailed configurations enable the tools to accurately identify violations related to colour contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic mark-up, and other WCAG criteria, providing precise feedback on areas needing improvement. 

### You MUST apply regular updates

Maintaining automated accessibility testing tools and configurations with the latest accessibility standards and best practices is crucial for ensuring ongoing compliance and effectiveness. This involves regularly updating tools to their newest versions, which incorporate the latest WCAG guidelines and bug fixes, and reviewing configuration settings to reflect evolving standards. Regularly updating test scripts ensures they accurately target current accessibility requirements and remain effective in identifying new or emerging issues. This proactive maintenance prevents the accumulation of technical debt, reduces the risk of overlooking critical accessibility flaws, and guarantees that automated tests provide reliable and relevant feedback.
