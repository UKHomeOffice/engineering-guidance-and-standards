Both options easily configurable and restyled, Eleventy plugin receives slightly more regular and recent maintenance.                                                                                 | Use the x-Gov Eleventy Plugin for creation of this site, due to better in house familiarity with Node.js and better record of plugin maintenance.                                                                                                                                 | 2022-05-17    | None                            |
| 66                                | Add secret scanning to GitHub repository                                                                                            | GitHub provides secret scanning functionality. Users will receive alerts on GitHub for detected secrets, keys, or other tokens. Push protection can be enabled which will block commits that contain [supported secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets). These settings can be found within the settings section "Code security and analysis". | Enable "Secret scanning" with "Push protection" within repository settings. Organisation administrators, repository administrators and teams with the security manager role will receive alerts when scan detects a secret.                                                       | 2023-06-01    | None                            |

It is not considered to be a high priority issue by the Gov.uk design system team. See [Github issue where phase banner and landmarks is discussed](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1604). We will revisit this decision as part of a planned review of the site design as a whole.                                    | Axe-core has been configured to ignore elements with a `data-axe-exclude` attribute. This has been added to the phase banner and breadcrumbs.                                                                                                                                     | 2023-06-16    | None                            |
