| N/A (Initial repository creation)     | Choice of static site generator                                    | Considered use of the [GDS Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) (Ruby based) and the [x-Gov Eleventy Plugin](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin) (Node.js based). Both options easily configurable and restyled, Eleventy plugin receives slightly more regular and recent maintenance. | Use the x-Gov Eleventy Plugin for creation of this site, due to better inhouse familiarity with Node.js and better record of plugin maintenance. | 2022-05-17    | None                |
| 66     | Add secret scanning to GitHub repository                                    | GitHub provides secret scanning functionality. Users will receive alerts on GitHub for detected secrets, keys, or other tokens. Push protection can be enabled which will block commits that contain [supported secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets). These settings can be found within the settings section "Code security and analysis". | Enable "Secret scanning" with "Push protection" within repository settings. Organisation administrators, repository administrators and teams with the security manager role will receive alerts when scan detects a secret. | 2023-06-01    | None                |
| 65     | Add dependency vulnerability scanning using Dependabot to GitHub repository | GitHib provides dependency vulnerability scanning functionality. [Dependabot can be configured to automatically raise pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates).                                                                                                                                 | Dependabot configured to scan npm dependencies daily and github-actions dependencies weekly. These differ due to anticipated update cadence.                                                                                | 2023-06-02    | None                |
| 130    | Ignore phase banner being outside landmark regions                          | Those elements being outside a landmark region is a moderate level failure. It is not considered to be a high priority issue by the Gov.uk design system team. See [Github issue where phase banner and landmarks is discussed](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1604). We will revisit this decision as part of a planned review of the site design as a whole.                                    | Axe-core has been configured to ignore elements with a `data-axe-exclude` attribute. This has been added to the phase banner and breadcrumbs.                                                                               | 2023-06-16    | None                |
